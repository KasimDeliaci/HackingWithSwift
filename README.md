# Swift Learning Journal ðŸš€

This repository documents my daily journey learning the Swift programming language. Each day, I explore a different topic, providing in-depth explanations and practical examples.

## Table of Contents

1. **Day 1: Variables and Constants**
   - Swiftâ€™s fundamental concepts, including variable and constant declarations, data types, type safety, and basic string manipulations
   - [Day 1: Introduction to Swift](https://github.com/KasimDeliaci/HackingWithSwift/blob/main/Contents/Day1.md)
   - [Apple Documentation: The Basics](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/thebasics/)

2. **Day 2: Complex Data Types**
   - Swiftâ€™s complex data types, focusing on arrays and sets, their characteristics, type annotations, and manipulation methods
   - [Day 2: Collections](https://github.com/KasimDeliaci/HackingWithSwift/blob/main/Contents/Day2.md)
   - [Apple Documentation: Collection Types](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/collectiontypes/)

3. **Day 3: Control Flow**
   - Swiftâ€™s operators and control flow mechanisms, covering arithmetic operations, operator overloading, compound assignment, comparison operators, conditions, and logical operators, all essential for effective decision-making in code.
   - [Day 3: Operators and Conditions](https://github.com/KasimDeliaci/HackingWithSwift/blob/main/Contents/Day3.md)
   - [Apple Documentation: Basic Operators](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/basicoperators/)

4. **Day 4: Loops**
   - Swiftâ€™s loop constructsâ€”for, while, and repeat-while loopsâ€”demonstrating their use in iterating over ranges and collections, and managing control flow based on conditions.
   - [Day 4: Loops](https://github.com/KasimDeliaci/HackingWithSwift/blob/main/Contents/Day4.md)
   - [Apple Documentation: Control Flow](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/controlflow/)

5. **Day 5: Functions**
   - Swift functions, covering their declaration, parameter usage, return values, and the ability to return multiple values using tuples.
   - [Day 5: Functions](https://github.com/KasimDeliaci/HackingWithSwift/blob/main/Contents/Day5.md)
   - [Apple Documentation: Functions](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/functions/)
  
6. **Day 5 EXTRA: Parameter Passing Mechanism**
   - Swiftâ€™s parameter passing mechanisms, focusing on the use of inout parameters to allow functions to modify variables directly, thereby enabling pass-by-reference behavior
   - [Day 5: Parameter Passing Mechanism](https://github.com/KasimDeliaci/HackingWithSwift/blob/main/Contents/Day5_Param_Passing_Mechanism.md)
   - [Apple Documentation: Functions](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/functions/)
  
7. **Day 6: Closures - Part One**
   - Swiftâ€™s closure expressions, exploring their syntax, capturing values, and practical applications within the language.
   - [Day 6: Closures - Part One](https://github.com/KasimDeliaci/HackingWithSwift/blob/main/Contents/Day6.md)
   - [Apple Documentation: Closures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/closures/)
  
8. **Day 7: Closures - Part Two**
   - Swiftâ€™s closures, advanced syntax, capturing values, returning closures, and practical applications within the language.
   - [Day 7: Closures - Part Two](https://github.com/KasimDeliaci/HackingWithSwift/blob/main/Contents/Day7.md)
   - [Apple Documentation: Closures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/closures/)
  
9. **Day 8: Structs - Part One**
   - Swiftâ€™s structures, covering their definition, stored and computed properties, methods.
   - [Day 8: Structs - Part One](https://github.com/KasimDeliaci/HackingWithSwift/blob/main/Contents/Da8.md)
   - [Apple Documentation: Structs](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/classesandstructures/)
  
10. **Day 9: Structs - Part Two**
   - Swiftâ€™s advanced struct features
   - [Day 9: Structs - Part Two](https://github.com/KasimDeliaci/HackingWithSwift/blob/main/Contents/Da9.md)
   - [Apple Documentation: InÄ±talization](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/initialization/)
   - [Apple Documentation: Properties](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/properties/)
