# Swift Operators and Conditions üöÄ

## üìù Introduction to Swift Operators
Swift provides a rich set of operators that allow developers to perform various computational and logical operations with elegance and precision. Understanding these operators is crucial for writing efficient and readable code.

## üßÆ Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators perform basic mathematical calculations on numeric values.

```swift
var firstScore = 12
var secondScore = 4

var sum = firstScore + secondScore        // 16
var difference = firstScore - secondScore // 8
var product = firstScore * secondScore    // 48
var quotient = firstScore / secondScore   // 3
var remainder = 13 % 3                    // 1
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:** Swift enforces strict type safety. You cannot directly perform arithmetic operations between different numeric types (e.g., mixing Double and Int).
**üìùNote:** Swift also has a .isMultipleOf(of: Int ) function to check if a number is mutiple of something.


## üîÑ Operator Overloading
Operator overloading allows the same operator to behave differently based on the context.

```swift
// Numeric addition
let meaningOfLife: Int = 42
let doubleMeaningOfLife: Double = 42 + 42

// String concatenation
let str1 = "Haters gonna "
let str2 = "hate."
let finalString = str1 + str2

// Array joining
let array1: [Int] = [1, 2, 3]
let array2: [Int] = [4, 5, 6]
let joinedArray: [Int] = array1 + array2
```

## üöÄ Compound Assignment Operators
Shorthand operators that combine an operation with assignment.

```swift
var examScore = 90
examScore += 10  // Add and assign
examScore -= 5   // Subtract and assign
examScore *= 2   // Multiply and assign
examScore /= 3   // Divide and assign

var str = "Hello"
str += " World"  // String concatenation and assign
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Comparison Operators
Operators to compare values and create logical conditions.

```swift
var score1 = 9
var score2 = 5

score1 == score2  // Equality check
score1 != score2  // Inequality check
score1 > score2   // Greater than
score1 < score2   // Less than
score1 >= score2  // Greater than or equal
score1 <= score2  // Less than or equal

// String comparison
"a" > "b"  // false (alphabetical order)

// Enum comparison
enum Sizes: Comparable {
    case small
    case medium
    case large
}

let first = Sizes.small
let second = Sizes.large
first < second  // true
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:** You cant compare double - int or string - int etc ! 

## üîÄ Conditional Statements
Swift provides powerful ways to control program flow based on conditions.

### üéØ If-Else Conditions
```swift
var firstCard = 11
var secondCard = 10

if firstCard + secondCard == 2 {
    print("Aces ‚Äì lucky!")
} else if firstCard + secondCard == 21 {
    print("Blackjack!")
} else {
    print("Regular cards")
}
```

### üîó Combining Conditions
```swift
let age1 = 12
let age2 = 21

if age1 > 18 && age2 > 18 {
    print("Both are over 18")
}

if age1 > 18 || age2 > 18 {
    print("At least one is over 18")
}
```

## üé≤ Ternary Operator
A concise way to write simple conditional expressions.
condition (true or false ) ? expression1 ( if true) : expression2 ( if false )

```swift
let age = 12
let result = age > 18 ? "Over 18" : "Under 18"
```

## üîç Switch Statements
Provides a clean way to handle multiple condition branches.

```swift
let weather = "sunny"

switch weather {
case "rain":
    print("Bring an umbrella")
case "snow":
    print("Wrap up warm")
case "sunny":
    print("Wear sunscreen")
    fallthrough
default:
    print("Enjoy your day!")
}
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:** default is required to ensure all cases are covered. <br /> 
**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note:** fallthrough: Swift will only run the code inside each case. If you want execution to continue on to the next case, use the fallthrough keyword

## üìä Range Operators
Swift offers two range operators for creating sequences.
 x..<y --> creates ranges up to but excluding the final value(y) = [x, y)
 x...y --> creates ranges up to and including the final value(y) = [x, y]

```swift
let score = 85

switch score {
case 0..<50:
    print("You failed badly.")
case 50..<85:
    print("You did OK.")
default:
    print("You did great!")
}
```

## üèÅ Key Takeaways
- Swift uses type-safe operators
- Operator behavior can change based on context (overloading)
- Compound assignment operators provide concise code
- Comparison operators work with various types
- Conditional statements offer flexible control flow

## üåü Pro Developer Tips
- Always be aware of type compatibility when using operators
- Use parentheses to clarify complex conditions
- Prefer `switch` statements over long `if-else` chains
- Leverage range operators for more readable code
- Use the ternary operator for simple, one-line conditionals
- Remember that `fallthrough` in switch statements is not default behavior
